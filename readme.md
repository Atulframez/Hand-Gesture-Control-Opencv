# Hand Gesture Control Using Computer Vision

This project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand gestures and map them to simple game controls like moving forward, left, right, jumping, and moving backward.

The project uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection and gesture recognition.

## Features

- Detects hand gestures in real-time.
- Maps gestures to game controls:
  - **Move Forward**: Fingers pointing towards the screen.
  - **Move Left**: Fingers pointing left.
  - **Move Right**: Fingers pointing right.
  - **Move Backward**: Fingers pointing downward.
  - **Jump**: Fingers pointing upward.
- Implements a delay between actions to prevent rapid switching of game controls.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
